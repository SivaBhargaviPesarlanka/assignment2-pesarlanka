###### My favourite sport is Cricket
Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. It is a **bat-and-ball game** played on a roughly oval grass field, in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 20.12 m (22 yards) long, called a pitch.<br> It is referred to as ***the gentleman's game***. It is played in three formats: test cricket, T20, and ODI.
